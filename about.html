        “ At Prestige we’ve seen the city transform itself and may be we’ve helped raised its style quotient while learning so much ourselves. My father had a vision of Prestige and its role in Bangalore but I think even him, with his foresight, couldn’t have seen how far all this would go. Still he’s the one who took the first step and his ideals and convictions are even more meaningful today. So at this point in the journey, on the threshold of yet another major step, we at Prestige and over three generations of well-dressed Bangaloreans has him to thank”.
